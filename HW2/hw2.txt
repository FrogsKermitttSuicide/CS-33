>>> Magic 8 Ball

To get the array of characters at magic8ball[3][4], aka a string, we must first do some octal arithmetic to get the displacement from magic8ball's initial address.
   3 * 8 ^ 2 + 4 * 8
  = 192 + 32
  = 224
  = 0xe0

magic8ball begins at 0x7fffffffe000 so magic8ball[3][4] is at 
    0x7fffffffe000 + 0xe0 
  = 0x7fffffffe0e0

Going down to that address, we can see the characters in the strings represented in their ASCII values as 0x57,0x72, 0x6f, 0x6e, and 0x67.

Using an ASCII table to obtain the characters, the correct string is "Wrong".
